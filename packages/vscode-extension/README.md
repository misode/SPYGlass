Spyglass aims at improving users' editing experience of Minecraft data packs by providing IntelliSense features like real-time error reporting, auto-completion, semantic coloring, and code navigation tools.

## Configuration <small>[[docs](https://spyglassmc.com/user/config)]</small>
By default, Spyglass will look for a `pack.mcmeta` file containing a `pack_format` value. The Minecraft release version matching that pack format will be used to determine the vanilla data pack, validation schemas for JSON and NBT, command-specific checks, etc.

If you wish to override the detected version, for example when working in multi-version packs, create a `spyglass.json` file at the workspace root containing:
```json
{
   "env": {
      "gameVersion": "1.20.6"
   }
}
```

## Features

### Semantic coloring
All command arguments are colored semantically. This extension includes [syntax-mcfunction](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MinecraftCommands.syntax-mcfunction) as a dependency to get instant coloring feedback.

### Diagnostics
Spyglass provides real-time diagnostics about your commands and JSON files. It can show syntax errors as Minecraft does, and even give you more detailed warnings.

### Code completions
The extension can compute completions as you type commands. Completions will automatically show when typing certain characters. Alternatively you can use Ctrl + Space (or other configured hotkey) to show completions manually.

### Definition links
You can navigate to functions, advancements, loot tables, and other resources by Ctrl-clicking on their namespaced IDs. This even works for vanilla resources.

### Peek references
You can find all the references of objectives, tags, data storages, functions, and other resources in the workspace by pressing Shift + F12 or other configured key.

## Commands <small>[[docs](https://spyglassmc.com/user/commands)]</small>

### Reset project cache
Spyglass uses a cache to speedup the process of validating, finding references/definitions, document links, etc. However the cache may become outdated because of various reasons, which could lead to strange behaviors. You can use the `Spyglass: Reset Project Cache` command to regenerate the cache manually. You can open the command oromt ysung Ctrl+Shift+P (or other configured hotkey).

### Open cache folder
If you are still experiencing problems after running the above command, you can navigate to the cache folder by using the `Spyglass: Open Cache Folder` command and wiping the folder. This removes the downloaded vanilla data pack, project caches, etc.
